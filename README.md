Data set used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanyamgoyal401/customer-purchases-behaviour-dataset

In this GitHub repository analysis project, we aim to gain comprehensive insights into customer behavior and preferences across various categories. Our analysis delves into demographic factors such as age, gender, income, and education, exploring how these attributes influence customer engagement and purchasing patterns. Additionally, we investigate loyalty status segments to understand the dynamics between customer loyalty and key metrics like purchase frequency, amount, and product preferences. Furthermore, we examine the impact of promotions on different customer segments, aiming to uncover patterns in promotional response and its correlation with customer behavior. Lastly, we assess overall satisfaction scores to gauge customer sentiment and satisfaction levels, providing a holistic view of customer experience within the analyzed repository. Through these inquiries, we seek to inform strategic decision-making and optimize marketing efforts tailored to diverse customer segments and preferences.
